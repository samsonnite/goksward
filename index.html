		<p class="long-copy">Let’s look at an example. Someone decides that the
			worst thing in the world would be for their loved one to
			leave them. They worry about this day and night. It is their
			worst fear and they can’t get it out of their mind. As they
			focus on this fear, they find that they simply cannot trust the
			person they are with. They are constantly second guessing
			this person and accusing them of the fears they hold inside.
			Instead of showing them love and affection, they are actually
			driving this person away.</p>
		
		    <p class="long-copy">When we create something, we always create it first
			in a thought form. If we are basically positive in
			attitude, expecting and envisioning pleasure,
			satisfaction and happiness, we will attract and
			create people, situations, and events which conform
				to our positive expectations.</p>
			
	         
		        <p class="long-copy">The power of attraction is not only a great mystery in
				terms of the stars and planets but a great mystery in terms of
				people’s lives. When two people come together, there is
				often an irresistible quality of attraction that overpowers
				every other desire they have. Because this power is so closely
				connected with the power of love, the attraction can even
				keep two people together forever. If we are able to understand
				the factors behind this amazing power that can keep
				two people together forever, we will have to look more
				deeply beyond science and reason. We will have to consult
				some of the great spiritual minds that can give us a deeper
					glance into the nature of both attraction and love.</p>
					<p class="long-copy">In order to understand love and the greater sense of
			wholeness that it helps us to achieve in our lives, it is important
			that we first contend with the idea of separation. Just
			like the concept of attraction, the concept of separation is
			also a much wider concept that can be applied to almost
			every aspect of our universe. People become separated in
			their marriages but the concept of separation extends even
			further than just human relationships. Separation is something
			that science teaches us when we are just in grade
			school. We learn that objects can be divided into two halves.
			“The universe is incredibly large,” says the teacher “and we
			are incredibly small.” In the beginning, science teaches us
			about a universe of great complexity and we learn about this
			with eager eyes.
			We first learn that science is based on the necessary and
			useful idea of separation and yet, this very idea becomes
			something that is often a problem later in life. In order to
					cook our food, for instance, we need to know the scientific
			reason why the pots are separate from the pans. In order to
			serve the food, we need to know that the kitchen is separate
			from the dining room. Finally, in order to eat the meal, we
			need to know that the tables are separate from the chairs.
			This kind of knowledge is necessary for us to function and
			yet, it is not the kind of knowledge that really gives our lives
			meaning. It is not what gives our lives a lasting significance.
					Love is the thing that is found at the end of the road
			when all of our intricate concepts of separation and division
			will eventually leave us unfulfilled. Love rescues us from
			that split second with a completely different kind of perception.
			It comes to us directly and can even come in a single
			instant. In love, we have a larger vision of our dinner. We
			don’t focus on the differences between the pots and the pans.
			We don’t see just the tables and the chairs. Instead we have
			the impression of the entire house and our lovely mother as
			she makes us a delicious meal. In love, we eat the meal and
			feel grateful for all the things we have. We appreciate our
			family and the entire world around us.</p>
